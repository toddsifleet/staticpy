				<strong style = "margin-right: 5px;">&raquo;</strong>To enable the compiler to monitor your files and recompile anytime something changes you need to install <a href="http://packages.python.org/watchdog/installation.html">Watchdog</a>.  Watchdog is a very powerful filesystem monitor that monitors directories/files for changes.

			<p>
				<strong style = "margin-right: 5px;">&raquo;</strong>Now any change you make with in the docs directory will cause the site to re compile and serve the new version of you site

			</p>
			<p>
				<strong style = "margin-right: 5px;">&raquo;</strong> It only requires placing <b>{{ client_js_code }}</b> just below your head tag.  This snippet is removed when you do your final compilation, so it is never visible outside of your dev server.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong style = "margin-right: 5px;">&raquo;</strong>This is how I develop, I have a view of the site next to my text editor and every time I save I can immediately see the effects of my changes.  This type of development greatly reduces the length of the feedback loop.
