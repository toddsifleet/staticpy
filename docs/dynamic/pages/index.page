		<h1>Static Py -- Static Site Generator</h1>
		<p>
			An easy to use fully custamizable static site generator.  Static Py compiles simple <a href = "/page-files">.page files</a> into <a href = "http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> templates.  It comes with an active <a href = "/dev-tools#dev-server">development server</a> that makes iteration really quick.  These pages act as both documentation and an example of how to build a site with static py, jinja, and bootstrap.

			<h2><a href = "/page-data">Page Data</a></h2>
			<p>
				Each html page is represented by a .page file, which stores all data unique to this page.  There is no limit on what data you can store for each page, it is all parsed and passed into your templates.  The structure of your site is defined the same as the file structure of your .page files.

			<h2><a href = "/templates"> Templates</a></h2>
			<p>
				Static Py uses the <a href = "http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a> templating engine.  The only required template is base, this template is used for every page unless it is overwritten in the .page file.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Navigation is handled within the compiler and passed into every template, so you decide how it is displayed.

			<h2><a href = "/dev-tools">Development Tools</a></h2>
			<p>
				&raquo; A simple dev server is included to serve all of your static files
			</p>
			<p>
				&raquo; Another dev server can run in the background to notify the browser there has been an update and refresh the page.
			</p>
			<p>
				&raquo; Once you are done with your site, static py can upload it to s3 if you want.
